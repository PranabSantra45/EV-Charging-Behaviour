# EV Charging Behavior Analysis

This repository contains ongoing work on analyzing EV charging data to understand
usage patterns, peak charging hours, and load distribution.

## Current Status
🚧 Work in progress  
This project is not completed yet. Commits are made to track progress,
experiments, and learning.

## What is being done
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Date & time feature engineering
- Hour-wise and weekday-wise analysis
- Visualization using Python and Power BI (planned)

## Future Scope
- Build a time-series based prediction model for EV charging demand
- Forecast peak-hour load using historical charging patterns
- Experiment with regression and basic machine learning models
- Integrate predicted insights into Power BI dashboards.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI (upcoming)

## Notes
This repository will be updated gradually as the experiment progresses.
